Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Parameters:

```js
{
   action: "checkLicense",
   license: "LicenseKeyToCheck"
}
```

### Response

All responses are in JSON format and use HTTP status codes. Example:

```json

  "message": "Downloaded chevereto-pkg-bbf9ab00.zip (4.4 MB @6.27MB/s.)",
  "data": {

```

## Nginx server rules

You can generate Nginx server rules on the fly with an HTTP GET.

```text
GET /installer.php?getNginxRules HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
```

The response is in plain text and looks like this:

```text
# Chevereto nginx generated rules for http://localhost/
## Disable access to sensitive files
location ~* /(app|content|lib)/.*\.(po|php|lock|sql)$ {
  deny all;
}
## CORS headers
location ~* /.*\.(ttf|ttc|otf|eot|woff|woff2|font.css|css|js) {
  add_header Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*";
}
## Upload path for image content only and set 404 replacement
location ^~ /images/ {
  location ~* (jpe?g|png|gif) {
      log_not_found off;
      error_page 404 /content/images/system/default/404.gif;
  }
  return 403;
}
## Pretty URLs
location / {
  index index.php;
  try_files $uri $uri/ /index.php?$query_string;
}
# END Chevereto nginx rules
```
